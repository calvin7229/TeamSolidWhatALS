## Description
We are Team SolidWhat, presenting our project Adaptive Light Sensor project for HackAlliance 2021. Through our market research, we have identify a gap between individual brightness preferences under different lighting conditions and devicesâ€™ capability to automatically detect and adjust the brightness. Thus, we have come up with our solution, EnLIGHTen your screen, a dynamic brightness adjustment solution which captures the users preferences and adapt to the changes to provide a better user experience.
